The under-representation of women and other social groups in many fields of science, technology, and innovation (STI) has long been a source of concern. The Covid-19 pandemic has threatened progress towards gender balance that has been made in recent years. Gaps persist in a variety of STI activities, including in access to education in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), and in participation in academia and the broader research workforce.<br><br>

<h3><font color="4292c6">Monitoring indicators and policies to promote gender balance  </font></h3>
<br>
<p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:5%;margin-right:25%">   
Against this backdrop, most countries have established strategies and introduced policy initiatives that address such disparities. The OECD has been tracking these policy efforts through the STIP Compass interactive policy database, a joint European Commission-OECD initiative that aims to collect in one place qualitative and quantitative data on national trends in STI policy. The policy database also links to relevant statistical indicators from the <a href="https://www.oecd.org/sti/scoreboard.htm" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">STI.Scoreboard platform</a>. The portal&rsquo;s dashboard on <a href="https://stip.oecd.org/stip/interactive-dashboards/themes/TH54" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">gender balance and inclusiveness</a> includes information on more than 200 policy initiatives from 47 countries and the European Union (EU). The dashboard provides visual snapshots of the policy data by country or territory, yearly budget expenditure range and type of policy instrument used (see Figure 1). <br><br>

<p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:5%;margin-right:25%">
The database has information on 70 strategies and plans targeting gender imbalance in 30 countries and the EU. These strategies and plans articulate governments&rsquo; visions for effective gender equality and inclusion in STI, recognising that better representation of women improves research excellence and relevance. They seek to integrate the gender dimension across government policies, institutions and regulations. To name a few: 
 </p>     
<ul style="text-align:justify;padding-left:10%;margin-right:25%">
     <li>
         <p>In 2021, the EU <a href="https://stip.oecd.org/stip/interactive-dashboards/policy-initiatives/2021%2Fdata%2FpolicyInitiatives%2F99994436" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">strengthened provisions and requirements on gender equality (and inclusiveness) in its flagship Horizon Europe scheme</a>, aiming to create gender-equal working environments and to improve research quality.</p>

<h3><font color="4292c6">...but STEM fields are still not attractive enough for female students…  </font></h3><br>

<p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:5%;margin-right:25%">
 When considering all fields of studies jointly, OECD <a href="https://doi.org/10.1787/0d5ea7b3-en" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">education statistics</a> show that gender parity exists in <a href="https://stip.oecd.org/stats/Gender-StatTrends.html?i=WTER_XT&v=1&t=9999&r=1" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">tertiary education</a> entry rates. However, graduation rates and certain <a href="https://stip.oecd.org/stats/Gender-StatTrends.html?i=WTERENR_ICT_XICT&v=1&t=9999&r=1" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">scientific fields</a> reveal significant disparities.   <br><br>

 The size of gender gaps in STEM varies by scientific field of study and by level of education. While more than half of OECD countries have reached <a href="https://stip.oecd.org/stats/Gender-StatTrends.html?i=WTERGRAD_NSE_XT&v=6&t=2012,9999&r=1" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">gender parity in tertiary education graduates in natural sciences, mathematics and statistics</a>, no OECD country has done so for graduates in <a href="https://stip.oecd.org/stats/Gender-StatTrends.html?i=WTERGRAD_ICT_XT&v=6&t=2012,9999&r=1" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Information and Communication Technologies (ICT</a>) and in <a href="https://stip.oecd.org/stats/Gender-StatTrends.html?i=WTERENR_ENG_XENG&v=6&t=2013,9999&r=1" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">engineering, manufacturing and construction</a>. Gaps are wider for doctorate graduates, as only one-third of OECD countries have achieved <a href="https://stip.oecd.org/stats/Gender-StatTrends.html?i=WPHDGRAD_NSE_XT&v=6&t=2012,9999&r=1" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">gender parity in natural sciences, mathematics and statistics</a> doctorates, and no country has reached gender <a href="https://stip.oecd.org/stats/Gender-StatTrends.html?i=WPHDGRAD_ICT_XT&v=6&t=2012,9999&r=1" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">parity in ICT</a> and in <a href="https://stip.oecd.org/stats/Gender-StatTrends.html?i=WPHDGRAD_ENG_XT&v=6&t=2012,9999&r=1" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">engineering, manufacturing and construction</a>.

<h3><font color="4292c6">...which results in gaps in the research workforce </font></h3><br>

<p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:5%;margin-right:25%">
According to the latest <a href="https://doi.org/10.1787/19fc7ea3-en" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">OECD Research and Development Statistics</a>, women are under-represented in the total amount of researchers in the OECD area. Over the last decade, such gaps have either only decreased slightly or worsened in some countries (see Figure 2). Only Latvia has reached gender parity in the number of researchers (50.7% of women in the total researcher population in 2018). Various countries are still lagging behind significantly, with less than 30% of women participation in the research workforce. <br><br>
