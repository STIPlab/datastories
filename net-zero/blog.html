            The <a href="https://stip.oecd.org" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">STIP Compass portal</a> provides qualitative and quantitative data on national trends in science, technology and innovation (STI) policy. It now includes data collected on
            STI policy initiatives dedicated to tackling climate change in the energy sector. Developed in collaboration with the International Energy Agency (IEA), the <a href="https://stip.oecd.org/stip/net-zero-portal" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">STI policies for net zero portal</a>            provides information on hundreds of STI policies that explicitly support the transition to net zero carbon emissions. It draws on data submitted to the STI Policies Survey (organised by the European Commission and OECD) and data held in the
            IEA’s <a href="https://www.iea.org/policiesandmeasures" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Policies and Measures Database</a>.
            <br><br> Achieving <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/net-zero-by-2050" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">net-zero emissions by 2050</a> depends on dramatically scaling up clean energy technologies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. And
            having those technologies ready in time hinges on a rapid acceleration in innovation and R&D. STI policies have central roles to play in realising the transition to net zero, for example, funding R&D and innovation, promoting knowledge flows
            between different parts of the innovation system, and investing in major demonstration projects. The portal offers a better appreciation of the full landscape of STI policies targeting net zero, which should benefit policy mix design, policy
            learning, and, ultimately, policy coherence across governments.
            <br><br> The portal’s information is presented in a series of interactive dashboards that provide a high-level overview of policy landscapes, while offering the possibility to access details on specific policy initiatives. In common with other
            parts of STIP Compass, this policy data is complemented by links to <a href="https://stip.oecd.org/Stats/Netzero-StatTrends.html?i=GHG_GDP" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">statistical indicators</a> and related publications from several international organisations and the academic literature.
            <br><br> As of March 2023, the portal includes information on approximately 450 STI policy initiatives targeting net zero in the energy sector. These policies come from 40 countries and the European Union (EU), and involve around 150 government
            ministries and agencies. As Figure 1 shows, many of these initiatives are <a href="https://stip.oecd.org/stip/net-zero-portal/policy-initiatives?conceptUris=http:%2F%2Fstip.oecd.org%2Fmodel%23National_strategies_agendas_and_plansg" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">national strategies, agendas and plans</a> that specify strategic directions for STI to pursue net zero goals. Other commonly used instruments include <a href="https://stip.oecd.org/stip/net-zero-portal/policy-initiatives?conceptUris=http:%2F%2Fstip.oecd.org%2Fmodel%23Project_grants_for_public_research" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">project grants for

            Thirty-four countries and the EU report 135 <a href="https://stip.oecd.org/stip/net-zero-portal/policy-initiatives?conceptUris=http:%2F%2Fstip.oecd.org%2Fmodel%23National_strategies_agendas_and_plans" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">national STI strategies, agendas and plansl</a> that aim to help meet net zero objectives. Figure 2 outlines the diversity of focus areas in the strategies where countries have reported this information. They target
            primarily the energy sector (Figure 2a), but also transportation and agriculture and several other industries. For example, besides energy, Korea’s <a href="https://stip.oecd.org/stip/net-zero-portal/policy-initiatives/2021%2Fdata%2FpolicyInitiatives%2F99991557" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Implementation Plan for the Climate and Environment R&D Programme</a> targets the transportation,
            telecommunications and IT sectors.

        <font color="4292c6">Funding R&D through grants </font>
    </h3><br>

    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:5%;margin-right:25%">
        According to the latest available OECD statistics on Government budget appropriations or outlays for R&D, governments are annually allocating over 19 billion USD to energy R&D. A portion of this budget is used to fund the policy initiatives reported in
        the portal. For example, among the biggest spenders in the <a href="https://stip.oecd.org/stip/net-zero-portal/countries/UnitedStates" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">United States</a>, the <a href="https://stip.oecd.org/stip/net-zero-portal/policy-initiatives?conceptUris=http:%2F%2Fkim.oecd.org%2FTaxonomy%2FGeographicalAreas%23UnitedStates%7C%7CDepartment%20of%20Energy%20%20(DOE;)" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Department of Energy</a> and its sectoral departments play a central role in funding energy R&D. In <a href="https://stip.oecd.org/stip/net-zero-portal/countries/Japan" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Japan</a>, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry has established <a href="https://stip.oecd.org/stip/net-zero-portal/policy-initiatives/2021%2Fdata%2FpolicyInitiatives%2F99993641" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">19.2 billion USD fund</a>a
         to boost carbon-neutral innovation in the private sector over the next ten years. The EU reports the implementation of one of the world’s largest funding programmes for <a href="https://stip-pp.oecd.org/stip/net-zero-portal/policy-initiatives/2021%2Fdata%2FpolicyInitiatives%2F99993655" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">demonstration of innovative low-carbon technologies</a>,
        supporting high technology readiness level (TRL) technologies through market pilots and demonstrators with the aim of creating early markets for emerging technologies to help Europe in its transition towards climate neutrality.
        <br><br> Governments provide direct financial support to R&D in the form of grants for both the public and business sectors. The database includes information on 130 policy initiatives that provide <a href="https://stip.oecd.org/stip/net-zero-portal/policy-initiatives?conceptUris=http:%2F%2Fstip.oecd.org%2Fmodel%23Project_grants_for_public_research" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">project grants for public research</a> and 123 that
        provide <a href="C:\Users\keenan_m\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Word\allocate" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">R&D and innovation grants for business</a>. Table 1 shows the types of research supported by some of these initiatives (where data is available). As expected, much of the grant support to public research, such as that performed in universities,
        is ‘upstream’ of much of the grant support to businesses. Some initiatives offer a range of support covering the whole ‘research and innovation chain’. One example is in Germany, where three ministries responsible for different parts of the chain
        coordinate <a href="https://stip.oecd.org/stip/net-zero-portal/policy-initiatives/2021%2Fdata%2FpolicyInitiatives%2F99993829" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">the Seventh Energy Research Programme</a> to cover and integrate all technology levels, from fundamental research to commercialisation. Another example is the Austrian <a href="https://stip.oecd.org/stip/net-zero-portal/policy-initiatives/2021%2Fdata%2FpolicyInitiatives%2F24414" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Energy Research Programme</a>, founded by multiple ministries to strengthen
        the links between research and industry.

        <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:5%;margin-right:25%">
            The database has 50 examples of government STI policy support for networking and collaboration between system actors in pursuit of net zero. This support is delivered in a variety of ways. For instance, the <a href="https://stip.oecd.org/stip/net-zero-portal/policy-initiatives/2021%2Fdata%2FpolicyInitiatives%2F26706" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Institutes for Energy Transition (ITE)</a> in France promotes innovation in energy transitions by creating interdisciplinary collaboration. Ukraine hosts <a href="https://stip.oecd.org/stip/net-zero-portal/policy-initiatives?conceptUris=http:%2F%2Fkim.oecd.org%2FTaxonomy%2FGeographicalAreas%23Ukraine" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">networking events</a> where all stakeholders are invited to participate. A few initiatives focus only on the business sector, e.g. the Chilean <a href="https://stip.oecd.org/stip/net-zero-portal/policy-initiatives/2021%2Fdata%2FpolicyInitiatives%2F333343" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">business network for mining</a> and Australia’s <a href="https://stip.oecd.org/stip/net-zero-portal/policy-initiatives/2021%2Fdata%2FpolicyInitiatives%2F333333" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">international business partnerships</a>. Some countries report initiatives that combine network and collaborative platforms with financial support for R&D and innovation. An example is the <a href="https://stip.oecd.org/stip/net-zero-portal/policy-initiatives/2021%2Fdata%2FpolicyInitiatives%2F99993964" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Smart Energy Programme</a> in Finland, which aims to develop and internationalise automated smart energy system. <br><br>

            <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:5%;margin-right:25%">
                The net zero portal includes many initiatives dedicated to hydrogen as a pathway towards net zero. These include national hydrogen strategies, initiatives to promote international STI relationships, and joint R&D investments among countries and/or business
                sectors. For example, the United States Department of Energy’s long-standing <a href="https://stip.oecd.org/stip/net-zero-portal/policy-initiatives/2021%2Fdata%2FpolicyInitiatives%2F333396" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Hydrogen Program</a> is a coordinated cross-department effort to advance the affordable production, transport, storage, and use of carbon-neutral hydrogen across
                different sectors of the economy. More recently, Germany has initiated a number of schemes to promote <a href="https://stip.oecd.org/stip/net-zero-portal/policy-initiatives?conceptUris=http:%2F%2Fstip.oecd.org%2Ftaxonomy%2Fthemes%23TH25%7C%7Chttp:%2F%2Fkim.oecd.org%2FTaxonomy%2FGeographicalAreas%23Germany" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">international cooperation</a> on hydrogen R&D.</a>.
