In the past decade many papers have discussed innovation policies in terms of their design, assessment and impact. Drawing on those contributions, the EC-OECD STIP Compass suggests a detailed taxonomy of innovation policies with regard to their themes, target groups of beneficiaries and instruments. Implemented with a web platform, that taxonomy has promoted an extensive collection of information on innovation policy initiatives across OECD member countries. Using the STIP dataset (downloaded 06.04.2020) , the paper <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0040162521001402" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">"Evidence-based portfolios of innovation policy mixes: a cross-country analysis"</a> employs that taxonomy to identify the innovation policy mixes by referring to all the dimensions encompassed in each policy initiative, i.e., themes, targets, instruments. The evidence-based multidimensional analyses yield a typology and set of topics of innovation policy mixes that we use to conduct a cross-country analysis of innovation policy portfolios. <br><br>

Building on the detailed taxonomy provided by the STIP Compass and on the wide-ranging and detailed information entered by 62 countries, the paper implements a systematic analysis intended to define an evidence-based classification of innovation policy mixes, defined in terms of the policy themes, the groups of beneficiaries targeted, and the policy instruments coded and associated with each policy initiative. The paper proposes a multidimensional analysis, of coded information on the three policy dimensions (109 codes), complemented by another text analysis on free texts describing the objectives and backgrounds policies (over 6400 lemmas of nouns, adjectives and verbs). The results of the coded information provided the definitions of twelve policy mixes, while the analysis of free text descriptions singled out 15 topics that were used to explore the specific domains of the policy mixes detected. The results highlighted an evidence-based portfolio of twelve innovation policy mixes adopted by countries (results are available online for free consultation at <a href="https://www.poliinnovazione.unimore.it/policy-mix/)" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">https://www.poliinnovazione.unimore.it/policy-mix/)</a>. 
<br><br>
The twelve policy mixes are grouped into four main domains of innovation policy initiatives. The largest group consists of policy mixes intended to finance innovation with funds and grants. These account for 42.4% of policy initiatives. The other three domains range from 17.1% to 20.6%: Governance of innovation policy and ethics for strategic plans and agendas and multilevel governance; Training for innovation to foster the attitude of human resources towards innovation (PhD researchers, general support, and reducing the gender gap); Intermediating for innovation.  
<br><br>
The topics identified by the free text descriptions refer to four main areas: public interventions, private interventions, governance of innovation processes, and training for innovation processes. They add significant nuances to the various policy mixes, and in particular to the policies supporting the activities of innovation intermediaries, the largest group of policy initiatives (almost 20.6%), and which has a variety of focuses: collaboration, evaluation and implementation of innovation, public data & AI, sectors towards which innovations must be oriented, SMEs. The policy mix on ethics addresses various topics, but the most significant one concerns public data and AI. 
<br><br>
The results on cross-country portfolios of policy mixes show that the majority of countries have an average portfolio of innovation policy mixes, while a group of countries has an over-representation of policy mixes focused on the activities of innovation intermediaries. In some countries, these latter crowd out all the other mixes, to some extent encompassing many policy initiatives intended to foster the countryâ€™s preparedness for innovation. Countries with a presence of policy initiatives in innovation intermediaries well below the average portfolio mix display a variety of different compositions of innovation policy mixes, mainly in regard to interventions on human resources training and granting and funding of innovation.
<br><br>
Although the results emerging from the multidimensional analysis are promising, we are very cautious with regard to the cross-country comparison: figures on budget shares may define a different composition of the portfolios of innovation policy mixes; information on subnational policies may explain the low presence of some policy mixes in the portfolio of some countries in which innovation policies are undertaken not only at national level; the interplay of innovation policies and other industrial policies or education policies is expected to affect the these results; a longitudinal analysis would be needed to interpret them. 
<br><br>
The multidimensional classification in terms of policy mix can become a meso level query of the STIP Compass to obtain more effective cross-country comparisons. To further the STIP Compass importance for innovation policy analysis, some critical fragilities should be addressed by the EC-OECD initiative. 
<br><br>
The first fragility concerns the unit of analysis of policy instruments: choosing the national level as a reference for all EU and OECD countries simplifies the complexity of the policy instruments that in the different countries are developed on a subnational scale, as in the case of unitary states like Italy, or in the cases of federal states like Austria, Germany and the USA. 
<br><br>
A second cause of fragility relates to the classification of policy instruments and of target groups, as in the case of the STIP Compass classification of "innovation intermediaries", encompassing a broad area of interventions that.
<br><br>
A more pervasive fragility concerns the quality of the data provided by countries. Essential for effective use of the STIP Compass is that the comparison refers to the policies that countries have implemented. Full information on the policy initiatives will shed light on the actual pattern characterizing the various policy mixes, thus allowing a cross-country interpretation of the composition of portfolios of policy initiatives in terms of resources that are invested for each component of the mix. Moreover, the temporal dimension deserves more accurate data: start-end dates could significantly improve our understanding of the development of innovation policies both in a cross-country perspective and a longitudinal one.
